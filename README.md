# Potluck by ManyHands


### About

This is a (very slow) work-in-progress that serves a few purposes: 

- refresher for building an app from scratch
- update my knowledge for Swift 4
- learning more about Swift best practices: optional handling, error handling, memory management, better networking, POP, dependency injection, testing, accessiblity, architecture, design patterns, localization, universal apps, online and offline data sync and management
- learning more about all the pieces that are required to build a non-trivial app: UX (user stories, wireframing, prototyping, graphic design), multiple servers, databases, CI, analytics, deployment, etc.
